Built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, this platform enables users to register, cast votes, and explore real‑time poll results. Leveraging JWT-based authentication and role-based access control, it provides clean separation between voter and admin interfaces.

#### Features
- Real‑time vote tracking
- Secure JWT-driven sessions
- RESTful APIs for seamless data flow
- Admin dashboard with poll and user management
