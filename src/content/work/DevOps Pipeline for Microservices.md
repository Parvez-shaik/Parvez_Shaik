Designed and implemented end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes, deployed on AWS EKS. This setup streamlines development by automating build, test, containerization, and deployment phases. Integrated monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana to track service health and performance metrics in real time.

#### Highlights

- Dockerized microservices orchestrated via EKS
- Automated testing and container builds
- Zero-downtime deployments with rollback support
- Active service monitoring and alerting
